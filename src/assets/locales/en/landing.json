It's as complex and energy-consuming as the work of a musician, artist, sculptor, etc. It is important that readers understand this and support you in favor for the content you create. It's good that such an feature appeared on Ryfma - the opportunity to help your favorite authors. Thanks.",

  "sponsor2Review2": "Sponsorship content expands the horizons for everyone who creates a literary product. At the same time, subscribers can choose any convenient way to support the author financially. It's also great that through Ryfma you can sell tickets to your events without using third-party services. Convenient, fast and everything in one place!",

  "sponsor2Review3": "I never thought that creativity can be monetized, believing that if you managed to release a book or make a concert, then this is rather an exception to the rule. But now on Ryfma I can use a cool feature that allows me not only to sell books, but also to make paid access to its individual chapters. Writers have a chance not to starve to death :)",
